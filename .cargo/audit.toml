# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: RSA timing sidechannel in rsa crate
# Status: No fix available from upstream
# Source: Transitive dependency from jsonwebtoken and sqlx-mysql
# Mitigation: We use jsonwebtoken with rust_crypto feature which uses different crypto backend
# Risk: Low - this is used for JWT verification in admin API, not for private key operations
